# Runs

This directory contains small shell scripts for reproducible example runs.

The style follows nanochat's `runs/` convention: a script should be readable, copy-pasteable, and useful as the reference way to run an experiment.

## Available Runs

```bash
bash runs/run_ci.sh
bash runs/run_docs_lint.sh
bash runs/run_bash_agent_demo.sh
bash runs/run_swebench_smoke.sh
```

`runs/run_ci.sh` mirrors the GitHub Actions workflow at
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: it syncs the dev dependency group, checks Ruff
formatting, runs docs lint, runs `ty` on `src/`, runs the full unittest suite,
and runs the deterministic bash-agent demo smoke. Use it as the local pre-push
gate.

The focused tests cover the canonical runtime:

```bash
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests/unit
```

This checks local Markdown links and backticked path references:

```bash
bash runs/run_docs_lint.sh
```

This runs a deterministic mini-SWE-style bash-use agent demo:

```bash
bash runs/run_bash_agent_demo.sh
```

This verifies the SWE-bench adapter's local unit-smoke path without installing
SWE-bench or running Docker:

```bash
bash runs/run_swebench_smoke.sh
```
